Beer Brawl
----------

A mobile app style website that helps you calculate the best beer offer in the shop.

You simply tell it the details of two offers and it will tell you the best deal to purchase.

Either make your purchase or press Winner Stays On to compare the winning offer to another one.

You can even factor in the ABV (strength) to be sure you get the best bang for your buck!
